Hello everyone. I'm Şükrü. I want to introduce one of my works with HTML and CSS. I know I'm new in front-end development and there is a long way to take. I'm so adamant that I believe I will be a good webpage developer in a couple of months. 
In this study, I aim to learn and practice form elements in HTML. I hope you like it. Bye.
